 My fiance (left) and I (right).

Iâ€™m a dual degree student with a degree in Theatre (technology and design) and Adolescent Education (Math).  So far I have taken Computer Science I and II.  I have always been around computers, I started using them at a fairly young age, and have thoroughly enjoyed learning about computer science.  I regret not starting my computer science journey sooner.  
I have been taking computer science courses alongside my Math Ed course work so that I can become certified to teach computer science once the certification is available.  I feel that having knowledge about computer science will be beneficial when job hunting and that being able to introduce students to computer science in high school will be a great opportunity.
